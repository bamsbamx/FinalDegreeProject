# FinalDegreeProject
This repo contains the source code files needed to accomplish the contents of my final degree proyect, based on the Siemens SIMATIC IOT2040 system dedicated to the industry IoT

This project relies on the usage of the Arduino capability of the IOT2040 to implement a TinkerKit! called Arduino shield, in order to make sensor/actuator installation faster and easier. To be able to get access to the TinkerKit! shield I/O pins, it is a must to make an adaptation of the [TinkerKit! code for Arduino](https://github.com/TinkerKit/TinkerKit) to make it work with Intel's [mraa](https://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/) core libraries. That said, such adaptation can be found in the [/libraries](https://github.com/bamsbamx/FinalDegreeProject/tree/master/libraries) folder of this repo
